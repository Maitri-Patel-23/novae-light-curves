# Nova Light Curve: V7992 Sgr

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that analyze the light curve of the nova **V7992 Sgr**, using AAVSO data.

## Contents

- `V7992_Sgr_LightCurve-compute-t2-t3.ipynb`: Plots the full light curve and computes t2/t3 values.
- `V7992_Sgr_V_Filter_LightCurve.ipynb`: Filters the light curve data using only the V filter for higher accuracy in brightness analysis.

## How to Use
Open any `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Ensure the `V7992_Sgr.txt` file is in the same directory.

## Results
- The V filter notebook gives more precise t2 and t3 estimates based on filtered photometric data.
- Visualizations are provided for better understanding of the nova's brightness decline.
